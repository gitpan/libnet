Before building this extension you will require the following modules. The 
building of the Makefile will abort if you do not have the required versions.
All of these modules should be avaliable from CPAN (see README.CPAN for 
more information)

   IO     v1.05
   Socket v1.03

To configure the library, you must edit the configuration section of

   perl Configure

Then build and install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
